# jaysire

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of jaysire is to provide basic tools for generating jsPsych experiments in R. The goal in this project is to copy the interface for jsPsych as closely as possible, rather than attempting a more general "grammar of experiments" as per the (in development) [xprmntr package](https://github.com/djnavarro/xprmntr)

## Installation

You can install the released version of jaysire from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("jaysire")
```
