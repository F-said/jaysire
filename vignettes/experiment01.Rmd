title: "1. Choice RT task"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(jaysire)
set.seed(143)
```

In this example we'll build a relatively simple choice reaction time experiment. On any given trial, the participant will be presented with a grid displaying a set of crosses and circles, and the task is simply to judge whether there are more crosses or more circles in the array. Responses are generated by pressing a key.
